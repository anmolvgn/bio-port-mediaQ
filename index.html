				It's a pleasure to meet you! My name is Anmol Nuggehalli. I am a student of economics and political science an alumni of Colorado State University (CSU). In light of having certain economic truths realized, I decided to delve into web development to further my economic independence through technical skills to adapt to the ever-evolving and modern nature of the labor markets and needs of the modern office. I have had prior interest in coding while in grade school and during my secondary education, but had very few quality resources available at the time for proper training. I still carry a healthy and insatiable appetite and passion for politics, policy discourse, economics, the sciences, and writing. It is my hope that throughout my six-month rigorous training in coding and programming that I will gain skills that will complement and to my knowledge-base required to prosper in the future. Throughout my six months, I will provide you with a portfolio of projects I have undertaken, from the simple skills-test based projects to projects that demonstrate more relavence to my professional aspirations. Feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, or to even meet for a coffee! I have provided my contact info here. I look forward to meeting you!
